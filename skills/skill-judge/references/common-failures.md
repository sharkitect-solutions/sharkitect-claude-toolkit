# Common Failure Patterns & Quick Reference

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Tutorial
```
Symptom: Explains what PDF is, how Python works, basic library usage
Root cause: Author assumes Skill should "teach" the model
Fix: Claude already knows this. Delete all basic explanations.
     Focus on expert decisions, trade-offs, and anti-patterns.
```

### Pattern 2: The Dump
```
Symptom: SKILL.md is 800+ lines with everything included
Root cause: No progressive disclosure design
Fix: Core routing and decision trees in SKILL.md (<300 lines ideal)
     Detailed content in references/, loaded on-demand
```

### Pattern 3: The Orphan References
```
Symptom: References directory exists but files are never loaded
Root cause: No explicit loading triggers
Fix: Add "MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE" at workflow decision points
     Add "Do NOT Load" to prevent over-loading
```

### Pattern 4: The Checkbox Procedure
```
Symptom: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... mechanical procedures
Root cause: Author thinks in procedures, not thinking frameworks
Fix: Transform into "Before doing X, ask yourself..."
     Focus on decision principles, not operation sequences
```

### Pattern 5: The Vague Warning
```
Symptom: "Be careful", "avoid errors", "consider edge cases"
Root cause: Author knows things can go wrong but hasn't articulated specifics
Fix: Specific NEVER list with concrete examples and non-obvious reasons
     "NEVER use X because [specific problem that takes experience to learn]"
```

### Pattern 6: The Invisible Skill
```
Symptom: Great content but skill rarely gets activated
Root cause: Description is vague, missing keywords, or lacks trigger scenarios
Fix: Description must answer WHAT, WHEN, and include KEYWORDS
     "Use when..." + specific scenarios + searchable terms

Example fix:
BAD:  "Helps with document tasks"
GOOD: "Create, edit, and analyze .docx files. Use when working with
       Word documents, tracked changes, or professional document formatting."
```

### Pattern 7: The Wrong Location
```
Symptom: "When to use this Skill" section in body, not in description
Root cause: Misunderstanding of three-layer loading
Fix: Move all triggering information to description field
     Body is only loaded AFTER triggering decision is made
```

### Pattern 8: The Over-Engineered
```
Symptom: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
Root cause: Treating Skill like a software project
Fix: Delete all auxiliary files. Only include what Agent needs for the task.
     No documentation about the Skill itself.
```

### Pattern 9: The Freedom Mismatch
```
Symptom: Rigid scripts for creative tasks, vague guidance for fragile operations
Root cause: Not considering task fragility
Fix: High freedom for creative (principles, not steps)
     Low freedom for fragile (exact scripts, no parameters)
```

## Quick Reference Checklist

```
SKILL EVALUATION QUICK CHECK

KNOWLEDGE DELTA (most important):
  [ ] No "What is X" explanations for basic concepts
  [ ] No step-by-step tutorials for standard operations
  [ ] Has decision trees for non-obvious choices
  [ ] Has trade-offs only experts would know
  [ ] Has edge cases from real-world experience

MINDSET + PROCEDURES:
  [ ] Transfers thinking patterns (how to think about problems)
  [ ] Has "Before doing X, ask yourself..." frameworks
  [ ] Includes domain-specific procedures Claude wouldn't know
  [ ] Distinguishes valuable procedures from generic ones

ANTI-PATTERNS:
  [ ] Has explicit NEVER list
  [ ] Anti-patterns are specific, not vague
  [ ] Includes WHY (non-obvious reasons)

SPECIFICATION (description is critical!):
  [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter
  [ ] name: lowercase, <=64 chars
  [ ] description answers: WHAT does it do?
  [ ] description answers: WHEN should it be used?
  [ ] description contains trigger KEYWORDS
  [ ] description is specific enough for Agent to know when to use

STRUCTURE:
  [ ] SKILL.md < 500 lines (ideal < 300)
  [ ] Heavy content in references/
  [ ] Loading triggers embedded in workflow
  [ ] Has "Do NOT Load" for preventing over-loading

FREEDOM:
  [ ] Creative tasks -- High freedom (principles)
  [ ] Fragile operations -- Low freedom (exact scripts)

USABILITY:
  [ ] Decision trees for multi-path scenarios
  [ ] Working code examples
  [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
  [ ] Edge cases covered
```
