# Universal Protocols -- Sharkitect Digital

> **Scope:** All Sharkitect Digital internal workspaces.
> **Skip when:** CLAUDE.md PROJECT_PURPOSE contains "Universal AI Operating System"
> or workspace type is "client-project".
> **Authority:** This rule is the single source of truth for universal protocols.
> Workspace CLAUDE.md files may contain older copies of these items -- this rule
> takes precedence. Workspace CLAUDE.md extends these protocols with
> workspace-specific additions only.

## Pre-Task Checklist (before ANY work)

Run this checklist before starting any task. These items are non-negotiable.

- [ ] Read the request carefully. Confirm understanding before acting.
- [ ] Check your toolkit -- review all available skills, agents, tools, plugins, and MCPs. Identify which ones are relevant to this task. Use them.
- [ ] Check MEMORY.md -- review prior learnings, patterns, and preferences that apply to this task.
- [ ] Check workflows/ -- is there an existing SOP for this type of work? Follow it.
- [ ] Plan before executing -- identify what needs to be done, in what order, and present the plan before starting.
- [ ] If the task is ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question before proceeding.

> Workspace CLAUDE.md may define additional workspace-specific pre-task items. Run those too.

## Post-Task Checklist (after ANY work)

Run this checklist after completing any task. No task is "done" until post-task passes.

- [ ] Verify all outputs are saved, correct, and complete.
- [ ] Check cross-references -- if Document A was updated and Document B references it, update B.
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with session learnings (decisions, patterns, preferences discovered).
- [ ] If new patterns or processes were discovered, record them.
- [ ] Confirm nothing is left in an inconsistent or half-finished state.
- [ ] Run `/session-checkpoint` before closing the session.

> Workspace CLAUDE.md may define additional workspace-specific post-task items. Run those too.

## Session Lifecycle

### Session Start
1. Read MEMORY.md -- check pending items, patterns, preferences.
2. `git pull` if remote exists (cross-computer sync).
3. Resume from where last session left off.

### During Session (at stage completions / checkpoints)
1. Update MEMORY.md with decisions and progress.
2. Push state to Supabase (if configured for this workspace).
3. Git checkpoint (commit + push) at significant milestones.

### Session End
- Run `/session-checkpoint` -- this invokes the full 9-step end-of-session protocol:
  1. Resource audit verification
  2. MEMORY.md update
  3. Lessons learned capture
  4. Plan status update
  5. Pending items documentation
  6. Workspace-specific checklist (reads CLAUDE.md)
  7. Git checkpoint (commit + push)
  8. Supabase brain sync
  9. Summary report (pass/fail per step)
- The session-checkpoint skill handles everything. Do NOT skip it.
- Do NOT close a session without running `/session-checkpoint`.

## Memory Protocol

### Architecture
- **Project MEMORY.md** -- Auto-loaded every session. Hard limit: 200 lines (content beyond 200 is truncated and invisible). Keep as concise index. Move detailed content into separate topic files in the same directory and reference them from MEMORY.md.
- **Topic files** -- For detailed notes that don't fit in MEMORY.md's 200-line limit. Store in the same memory directory (e.g., `session-history.md`, `patterns.md`, `debugging-notes.md`). Reference from MEMORY.md.

### Session Memory Protocol
**Every session, without exception:**
1. **Start of session:** Read MEMORY.md. Understand what was learned before. Check for pending items, known patterns, and user preferences.
2. **During session:** When a significant decision is made, a pattern is discovered, or a task outcome is known -- update memory immediately. Do not wait until the end.
3. **End of session:** Append a session log entry. Update patterns if confirmed. Record what worked, what failed, and what was learned.

### What to Record
- Decisions made and the reasoning behind them
- Patterns confirmed across 2+ interactions
- User preferences (communication style, decision patterns, approval triggers)
- Solutions to recurring problems
- Process improvements that proved effective
- Failures, root causes, and what was done instead

### What NOT to Record
- Temporary session context that won't matter next time
- Speculation or unverified conclusions
- Duplicate information already in project documentation
- Information that contradicts established project rules without user approval

### 200-Line Discipline
MEMORY.md WILL be truncated at 200 lines. Plan for this:
- Keep the most important information (active rules, key patterns, pending items) in the FIRST 150 lines
- Session history summaries go in a separate `session-history.md` file
- Detailed technical notes go in topic-specific files
- Regularly prune outdated entries

## Pushback Protocol (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Never be a yes-agent. Before agreeing with any user design decision, ask: "Am I agreeing because this is right, or because the user suggested it?"

- If an approach has trade-offs the user hasn't considered, name them BEFORE agreeing
- If there's a simpler or more reliable way, say so even if the user is excited about their idea
- If the approach won't work technically, say so directly with the reason and an alternative
- If the user is over-engineering, call it out. Complexity is a cost.
- Frame pushback constructively: explain WHY it won't work and offer the alternative
- Trust requires honesty, not compliance. Agreement must mean "this is actually the right call."

## Extension Rule

Workspace CLAUDE.md files define ONLY workspace-specific additions to these protocols. They should NOT duplicate items listed above, but if they do, this rule is authoritative.

If a workspace CLAUDE.md explicitly contradicts this rule (e.g., "do NOT run resource-auditor in this workspace"), the workspace CLAUDE.md wins for that workspace. This is the local override principle -- universal protocols are the baseline, workspace instructions can override for their specific context.
